# Skill, Extension, and Pi Package

When you first start extending Pi, these three names are easy to mix up. Each one solves a different problem — a working method, an executable capability, and resource distribution — and there is no hierarchy from low to high among them.

| Name | Can be understood as | Good for solving | When a beginner uses it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Skill | A specialized capability package loaded on demand | Provides a description of the workflow, and can also carry scripts, resources, and reference documents | When one kind of task has already been done several times and the method needs to be standardized |
| Extension | An executable capability loaded into Pi | New tools, commands, event handling, interfaces, or custom behavior | When an explanation alone is not enough and you really need code that runs |
| Pi Package | A package for distributing a set of Pi resources | Installs and shares Extensions, Skills, prompt templates, themes, and more all at once | When your combination is already stable and ready to be reused across many projects or by many people |

## First decide which category the problem belongs to

If every time you write a tutorial you have to explain all over again “check first whether the reader can verify it themselves”, that is closer to a Skill. Its value lies in a stable working method, and it does not necessarily need new code.

If you want the terminal to show a reminder when a task finishes, you need to watch Pi events and call a system capability. That is closer to an Extension.

If you want to hand a reminder Extension, a companion Skill, prompt templates, and a theme to another computer, that is when a Pi Package starts to make sense.

## The order for choosing

1. First run it manually on a real task.
2. For steps and standards that repeat, tidy them into a Skill.
3. If you genuinely lack an executable capability, then develop or install an Extension.
4. If you want to distribute to many projects or to other people, then consider a Package.

This order avoids one common problem: the task is not yet stable, but you have already collected many plugins and packages, and in the end you yourself cannot explain which layer is doing the work.

## Practice: loading a single teaching Skill

This lesson continues the fictional meeting notes from lesson 5. You will load a Skill that contains only text rules, so that Pi checks the action list against fixed fields. This Skill does not add system permissions, but the description inside it can still influence the Agent's behavior, so you must read its contents first.

### 1. Download and inspect

In a normal terminal, go into `pi-practice`, then download the teaching file:

```bash
mkdir -p bluebook-examples/action-list-review
curl -fL https://pi.argakuka.com/en/examples/skill/action-list-review/SKILL.md \
  -o bluebook-examples/action-list-review/SKILL.md
```

Open or view `bluebook-examples/action-list-review/SKILL.md` in the terminal. You will see two metadata fields, `name` and `description`, plus six rules that only concern reading, tidying, and checking meeting notes. If the file is empty, its contents are not plain text, or it asks you to run commands unrelated to the task, stop and do not load it.

### 2. Loading it explicitly

The following command is typed in a normal terminal. `--no-skills` ignores other Skills found automatically, and then `--skill` adds just the one file from this lesson:

```bash
pi --no-skills --skill ./bluebook-examples/action-list-review/SKILL.md
```

![Illustration: Si Hitam slides a card into a slot on a machine as a light turns on, labelled muat Skill and Skill aktif.](/en/images/05-pi-memuat-skill.webp)

The launch command explicitly names the Skill path, so the Skill is loaded and ready to be called explicitly. That says nothing about the result yet: it does not prove that the next file has already been produced.

Once you are inside Pi, if the `/skill:` command is available, type the following snippet to force a particular Skill to load; if the command does not appear, first enable Skill commands in `/settings`, then type it again:

```text
/skill:action-list-review Please re-check input/notulen-rapat.md,
then write the result to output/daftar-tindakan-revisi.md. Do not change the input file; for information that is not in the original source write “not explained in the original source”.
```

When Pi starts, it only puts the Skill's name and description into the context, while the full description is loaded on demand; the official documentation also warns that the model will not necessarily read it automatically every time, so this lesson uses `/skill:action-list-review` explicitly. This still does not mean the system will certainly run all the checks for you. Watch whether Pi really reads the input you specified and writes the output you specified; when it is done you still have to inspect the file yourself.

### 3. Verifying and disabling

After leaving Pi, run in a normal terminal:

```bash
test -f output/daftar-tindakan-revisi.md && echo "PASS: review version exists"
grep -c '^## ' output/daftar-tindakan-revisi.md
```

The first line should output `PASS`. The second line is there to help count; if your heading format differs, just open the file and make sure there are exactly three items, rather than relying only on this number.

This Skill is not installed into a global directory or a project's automatic discovery directory. When you run `pi` directly next time, this Skill will not stay loaded just because of this lesson's command. To use it again, include `--skill` again; to disable it, simply exit Pi this time and do not pass that parameter again.

::: tip Where to place it at the project level
Once you understand it and want the same project to find it automatically, put it in `.pi/skills/action-list-review/SKILL.md`. Project resources are loaded only after the project is trusted. When learning for the first time, use `--skill` explicitly first so that the origin and scope are easier to see.
:::

::: danger Read before installing
Pi Packages run with the current user's full system permissions. Besides executable Extensions, Skills and other resources can also direct the Agent to run commands or cause side effects. Do not trust something just because it is called a “package” or a “community resource”. Before installing, check the origin, the resources, and the installation contents of the whole package.

### Basis for this chapter

- [Pi Skills](https://pi.dev/docs/latest/skills)
- [Pi Extensions](https://pi.dev/docs/latest/extensions)
- [Pi Packages](https://pi.dev/docs/latest/packages)
- [The difference between Skill, Extension, and Pi Package](/en/tweets/04-skills-extensions)

The dynamic behavior above was verified on 2026-09-09. The teaching Skill was verified to be loaded temporarily in Pi 0.80.10 on this machine, and appeared in the `skill:action-list-review` command list; resource locations and Pi commands can be updated, so the related official pages are the reference.
