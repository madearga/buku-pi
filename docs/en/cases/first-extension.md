# Loading a minimal Extension

## Result

Load `bluebook-check.ts` explicitly, run `/bluebook-check` and see the expected notification, then confirm that the Extension is already disabled by running Pi without `-e`.

## Fixed materials

- Extension: <a href="/en/examples/extension/bluebook-check.ts" download>download bluebook-check.ts</a>

This code does not read or write files and does not access the network; it only registers one command. Still read the whole thing first, because every Extension runs with the user's permissions from the Pi process.

## 1. Download and Review

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/pi-practice
mkdir -p bluebook-examples
curl -fL https://pi.argakuka.com/en/examples/extension/bluebook-check.ts \
  -o bluebook-examples/bluebook-check.ts
sed -n '1,160p' bluebook-examples/bluebook-check.ts
```

Windows users should change the first line to `cd ~/pi-practice`. The real file should contain only one import, a default function, and `registerCommand`, with no network or file operation; stop if its content does not match.

## 2. Load and Run

Run in an ordinary terminal:

```bash
pi --no-extensions -e ./bluebook-examples/bluebook-check.ts
```

Once inside Pi, type:

```text
/bluebook-check
```

The expected Pi interface notification is `"The Buku Pi Extension has loaded; this command does not read or modify any files."`.

Once that fixed notification appears, only half of “load and run” is done; this case study also asks you to exit, then run again without `-e` to confirm that the command is gone.

## 3. Disable

Type `/quit` to return to the ordinary terminal, then run:

```bash
pi --no-extensions
```

At this point `/bluebook-check` should no longer appear. If it still does, check whether this run still carries `-e`, and whether the project or user Extension directory holds another file with the same name; do not delete a file whose source you do not know.

[Lesson 11](/en/guide/first-extension) continues the explanation of why desktop notifications need real system evidence; this case study only verifies the loading, execution, and disabling of a minimal command.

## Key Symptoms

The same command appears only when the learning Extension is passed explicitly, and disappears after you exit and run again with `--no-extensions`. This comparison proves the load-and-disable chain this time, not that any system notification actually appeared.

## Independent Verification

- After `pi --no-extensions -e <file>` runs, the command can be executed and shows a fixed notification.
- After running again without `-e`, the learning command is no longer available.
- A load error can be recovered by not loading that file; the practice materials and the session do not need to be deleted.

## One More Step: Turn It into Your Own Command

Copy the original file, and keep a baseline you can compare:

```bash
cp bluebook-examples/bluebook-check.ts bluebook-examples/bluebook-check-custom.ts
```

Open the new file and change only two places: change the command name in `registerCommand` to `bluebook-check-custom`; change its notification text to "Custom check finished; go ahead and keep checking the actual work." Do not add any file, network, or system operation.

Exit the old process first, then load the copy:

```bash
pi --no-extensions -e ./bluebook-examples/bluebook-check-custom.ts
```

Run `/bluebook-check-custom` in Pi, and you should see your own new text. The old command `/bluebook-check` should not be registered in this run's command list. After exiting, run again with `pi --no-extensions`, and both learning commands should not be registered.

Compare the two differences before and after the change: the command name determines how it is called, while the notification text determines the observable result. A real desktop notification still needs a system interface and foreground/background logic; see the further limits in [Lesson 11](/en/guide/first-extension).

## Failure Recovery

Save the complete load error together with its file path. Do not copy the file into several automatic discovery directories and retry over and over; first return to a clean state with `--no-extensions`, then review the downloaded content again.
